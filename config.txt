# This is the configuration file for the Pd IRC bot.
# Lines that begin with a # are comments and thus ignored.
# You can't start a comment in the middle of a line.
# Set an option by writing the name of the option, a space, and then the value of the option.
# Possible options you can set: nick user realname network port channel
# Keep in mind that this file will be read by Pd so you should avoid special characters like semicolons and commas.
# The 'realname' variable can't have spaces BECAUSE I'M LAZY, OKAY??!
# But yeah, anyway, remember to have fun.
